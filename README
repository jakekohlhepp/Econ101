This repository contains all of the lecture slides, exams and problem sets from my Economics 101 course at UCLA. Economics 101 is an upper division undergraduate course in microeconomics which focuses on applications of game theory to economic situations which deviate from the assumptiosn of perfect competition. This includes ucnertainty, market power, and asymmetric information.
